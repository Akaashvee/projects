# # MY JUPYTER NOTEBOOK FOR TOOLS FOR DATASCIENCE

# ### Welcome to my notebook. In this notebook, I will be exploring and understading the tools which are used in the data science and will analyze and visualize the data. I wanted to learn datascience because to develop skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence and for my Interest in working with data and deriving insights from it

# #### Data Science Languages include :
# Python: Python is the most popular language in the data science community
# 
# R: R is a language designed specifically for statistical computing and data analysis.
# 
# SQL: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.
# 
# MATLAB: MATLAB is a proprietary programming language that is commonly used in scientific computing, engineering, and data analysis.
# 
# Java: Java is a popular language in big data processing and analysis

# #### data science libraries include :
#     
# NumPy: For working with arrays and numerical operations

# #### Arithmetic expression :
#     
#  Addition: `1 + 2 = 3`
#  Subtraction: `9 - 1 = 8`
#  Multiplication: `6 * 2 = 12`
#  Division: `45 / 5 = 9`

# In[1]:


#To multiply and add numbers
a = 4
b = 5

# multiply a and b
c = a * b
print("Multiplication of", a, "and", b, "is", c)

# add a and b
d = a + b
print("Addition of", a, "and", b, "is", d)


# In[2]:


#To convert minutes to hours. 
minutes = 120  # assign a value of 120 to the variable minutes

hours = minutes / 60  # convert minutes to hours
print(minutes, "minutes is equal to", hours, "hours")
